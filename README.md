 Development Approach

The player was built from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I focused first on implementing essential functionality using the native `<video>` element. Once the base was working, I layered in interactivity, responsiveness, and additional UX enhancements like auto-hiding controls and remembering playback position using `localStorage`.

Special attention was given to responsiveness and clean user interactions across both desktop and mobile devices.

 AI Tool Usage

While the core logic, UI, and structure were designed and implemented manually, I used AI tools selectively to enhance and debug certain parts:

- ChatGPT 
  - Helped brainstorm feature implementation ideas like how to handle `localStorage` for resume playback.
  - Provided suggestions to improve JavaScript event handling and time formatting logic.
  - Assisted in enhancing responsiveness and CSS transitions for control visibility.

> AI was used as a support tool, not for full-code generation.
